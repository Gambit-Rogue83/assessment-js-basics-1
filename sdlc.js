// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which requirements and objectives of the software are analyzed. What does the customer need, what is the purpose of the product?"
const design = "This is the third step, in which the software is then designed. How will it be built? What language, tools and components are utilized and combined for the software program."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the software is implemented. Code is written and executed to ensure functionality."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the software is ran through various tests. Deficiencies are noted and smoothed out with more efficent code, feedback from software users are integrated for an enhanced UI."
const maintenance = "This is the sixth step, in which the software is maintained. New syntax and tools are upgraded to maintain peak performance and stability."
